# Leap-Years
Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not.


## Acceptance Criteria:

`A leap year is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.`
- All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years (so, for example, 2000 was indeed a leap year),
- All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years (so, for example, 1700, 1800, and 1900 were NOT leap years, NOR will 2100 be a leap year),
- All years divisible by 4 but not by 100 ARE leap years (e.g., 2008, 2012, 2016),
- All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years (e.g. 2017, 2018, 2019).
